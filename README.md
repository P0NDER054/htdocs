Place the contents of the template folder with you (along with the other supporting files and folders with they're respective records and references such as: photos, videos, or other prooofs you may be referring to by linking to your text files or keeping safe in a datetime folder. 

You can keep a copy on an http server at root level (public_html, or htdocs folder) and edit whenever necessary, and you can create new directories on your own if you need to keep things private as well, but if you really intend to keep them private, jot down a note to keep track of it's location rather than linking, or referring to it online (this includes robot text files which reveal private locations because we ask them to keep it private). 

If you would like to use a datetime folder for your media files, you can start with the one I provide with a folder for each month, year and day (be sure to allow for adaptations on leap years) but there are alternate calendars, including a calendar based upon seasons with 13 weeks and 91 days per season if you'd like to make things more private. Managing them isn't as easy, but it can be done with a reference table. 

Please feel free to contact me for additional information or support.
