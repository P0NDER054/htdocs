Keep the contents of the template folder with you (along with any other records and references such as: photos, videos, or other kinds of proof you may need to substantiate your claims. You may or may not refer to the location of these additional files in your log, subdirectory, or open letter. And you may, or may not also keep a list of the items you need and where you're keeping them on paper in a safe place so you know where to find them.

New in this draft is a license free version of every page. There are no third party providers for this website, so it is entirely yours. You don't have to update any proprietary Javascript, or CSS. This code that structures these pages is all provided by W3 CSS, which is entirely free for your own use. You may choose to modify the w3 CSS that I've provided in this template further (I've made a few modifications of my own), but don't forget to check your work with the Jigsaw CSS Validator if you do. 

You can keep a copy of your website on an http server by placing all the file and folders in the root directory (public_html, or htdocs folder) and edit whenever necessary with an FTP link to the folder, but you will need to replace the domain name 'example.com' with your own domain name in the sitemap, the robot text files, and in the subdirectory logs (new in this version). The new sub directories must use your domain name to link the media properly, but if you need to keep things private don't link the subdirectory log to a public page. If you really need to keep things private, keep a written log on paper, and your evidence completely off-line. Whenever linking, or referring to a file or directory online (this includes robot text files), web crawlers index the information whether we like it or not - potentially making it public knowledge on search engines. Robot text files will help to keep them off friendly search engines, but not all spiders and search engines are friendly, and some may not will respect our wishes. 

I've included a datetime folder with sample subdirectory logs for each of the most recent years with folders that you can lock for your media files. Its built with a standard calendar, by using a folder for each month, year and day (be sure to allow for adaptations on leap years), but there are alternative calendars if you want to obscure the location of sensitive files by using a calendar based upon seasons with 13 weeks and 91 days per season for example if you'd like to make things even more private. Managing the locations can be done fairly easily with a reference table that identifies what the standard calendar day is on the four seasons calendar.
