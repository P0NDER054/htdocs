  <div class="w3-third w3-cell">
    <p>I've written up a case to try to deal with hacks, but ended up hacked while doing so. If you'd like to follow along, I've attached a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6QscT9ajnJ7ZWY0kts79l-FzjRjQIxL6AAFchNZgDY/edit?usp=sharing">Case Details</a> and follow up communications.</p>
<p>And, I've been afforded an opportunity to pay back the SSA during years since 2012, but can't expect competitive employees to use that option, or my children to assume the high risk venture that this project has become without endangering them in the process, though I was able to refer them to an anonymous option developed by my professor (<a href="https://www.instigate.ai">Instigate AI</a>).</p>
<p>If they fail, or become disabled in the process of trying to keep a public log for example, or by using equipment to determine if an event is really happening (or not) become the target of a criminal, then the Trust that the project has become won't allow them to own the property they've developed (domains, copyrights, trademarks and equipment) and that doesn't seem fair. The Trust was developed to protect them precisely because these ventures are dangerous, so we granted our property to the Trust in order to stay safe and then tended to the properties to regain confidence in our property.</p>
<p>Because much of my income was lost while making the transition to a private venture, and an investor was prevented from providing a Fund to expand the Adaptive Medicine to a Biotech project, I found it difficult to pay anyone at all, so I’ve re-established the Trusteeship domains as a Government Project, and will continue to develop safer ways to deploy them (In <a href="http://the-trusteeship.com/local-ramifications.html">this case</a>, without any need for licensed web publications technology). So by redefining the Trust as a Government project, we may legitimately access funds from the government if things don't go well too.</p>
<p>I realized that after working with drunks for many years, many of them (including me) do not always, and perhaps still cannot remember what mistakes have caused the broken lives that we lead, so I resolved to find out what mine were. In some cases, I can regain a working knowledge of the problems that result. For example, by working with my family to recreate a scene from Redwood County in the 1970s, I was able to determine that jealousy, or envy of the men who were flirting with our girlfriends at the time may have bothered me so badly that I blacked the memories out.</p>
<p>What I didn't realize is that girls sometimes like the attention of men, so I returned to address the problem once again when my daughter reported 'hot' behavior in her mother's home (I was living out of State with my adopted family from South East Asia). We encountered the problem with others as well - across the alley from our place on the South East side of town, when we played Naked City with their family, but someone offended the young girl I was fond of by taking pictures of her in a Gas Station bathroom.<img style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;" class="w3-opacity w3-hover-opacity-off w3-image" src="images/gas-station-window.jpg" alt="Gas Station Bathroom window" /></p> 
  </div>
  <div class="w3-third w3-cell">
  <p>So I checked out the scene briefly on a day trip to the old neighborhood and found another place nearby that could use a website. This might seem like a ridiculous problem to work on at this time, but I haven’t been able to re-establish communication with my own children, and am still dealing with harassment in my home. Besides, I was told not to give up by the Police! So in order to root out the suspicions of those who are behind this kind of obstruction, I believe it best to continue to work on the problem of obtaining and using proof.</p> 
<p>I was able to turn the camera lens back upon myself as a child, but I have yet to find out anything about her offender himself, and trying to apprehend people like him proved to be particularly difficult because once I was offended, I couldn't remember what happened next. Fortunately, even before I contemplated problems like these, we were taught by the good people of the First Nation that the image we portray is our own. And, if you want to ‘take’ an image from someone, you first must ask for permission.</p>
    <p>And, because the drunks that I worked with before I left had nothing but a box of pictures and his pilot's license when he departed, returning to the fort in the vacant lot we built might make sense. We still don't know if he took the pictures when she was in the Gas Station bathroom, or if he was prying her when she was at home from across the vacant lot. Simple clarifications like this can make a big difference. At one point I considered the possibility that she might be referring to the Pin-ups that were at the Gas Station out of a misplaced envy of her own. To be clear would help.</p>
    
<p>I've revised <a href="http://imid.ltd/log.html">my log</a> to postulate that the changes we're living through now may be providing a new way to control humanity (by way of an unavoidable current established by the terraforming of this platform), but it came at a high cost. Experiments on cats, and later monkeys to map the visual cortex and control other patterns of behavior helped us to determine our capacity to see. The fact that we don’t always see doesn't mean that we aren't capable of it, or of visualizing in a general way. To focus on an object, or a scene, may unduly distract us from other things that may be even more important outside our field of view.</p> 
<p>Starting in the 1920's with the pioneering work of Rudolph Hess, the control of cognition and our state of mind has been documented and continued until this very day. At the bottom of the page, you'll find a more friendly introduction to what we believe is a better alternative to the invasive treatments than we began with at that time by way of ASMR, or the Tingling sensation.</p> 
<p>I suffered because I thought the cats who led me down the avenue were being persecuted for leading me astray. My uncle gathered up strays in our neighborhood to conduct horrible experiments on them at the University. With implants in their brains, they were helpless in the cages he tended to. But we were being traumatized by a stepdad who didn’t know how to tingle others at home. Rather, he tickled our necks and when we laughed, he choked us. So when I finally was tingled above the neck, I went into a tailspin. It seems ridiculous to me now; that's all my trauma amounted to, but because my memory failed as a result, we all ended up in serious trouble.</p>
<p>I taught him what tingling really was by pretending to crack an egg on his head during the years that followed and tracing where the runny egg yolk and egg white would go. Perhaps his display in Redwood County was his way of clarifying how to control a libido. Half naked after a shower - prancing in a towel - flexing his muscles and putting up the drawbridge. At least he enjoyed the experience. My depiction of his power to correct was a drunken mockery motivated by hate.  At our age, we were just realizing what had happened to other parts of our bodies, and it seemed most cruel to take any measure from us.</p>
<p><b>There's a whole world full of others with similar problems struggling to be free! Many of whom may not be capable of doing so without our help!</b></p>

  <p>Obstructions to blood flow might become explosive when absolutely necessary so I studied details like these at the same University and I'll be proceeding to operate by self employment to provide for my trust and the properties that belong to it, but what’s most important for me to share right now is the need to reach out to the old neighborhood and neighbors where the young girl was offended. Just as the drunk that I mentioned before indicated before he passed away, all he had left was a box full of pictures and his pilot license.</p>
  <p>What we really need to leave behind is how we can be helpful to others in order to help them regain control of their own person, their lives, their image, and their reputations. Not to become troubling to anyone else in the process, but to see if we can at a minimum - rule out the obstruction of those who are trying to determine what's going on, or those who need to prove that a crime has really taken place in order to find out more about those who are offending the kids and why.</p>
    <p>I realized when the police wouldn't use or provide the evidence I gathered that they must be keeping private for some reason. It’s clear to me that the Natives intended no harm, so I got angry when obstruction resulted in a skewed perspective of my claims, and further accusations of insanity. Please feel free to see: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6QscT9ajnJ7ZWY0kts79l-FzjRjQIxL6AAFchNZgDY/edit?usp=sharing">Case Details</a>. There are a few rare others, like Tim Berners Lee who have improved the capacity of the Internet to preserve what we began with by using it as a vehicle to keep us safe. The question is, what do we do about those who've been robbed of their self respect or privacy by dishonorable public display or the disruption of their opportunity to respond. There are many who now live with threat, intimidation and harassment for using photographic evidence to state a claim as well. Some might assume that a direct action campaign was used to be rid of me and my reporting, but I don’t believe those who've gone out of their way to be helpful would do so.</p>
<p>Previous efforts to call me out on the occasion of a birthday party happened to take place on the Anniversary of Kristallnacht, and there may be some who view me as a nit-picking CSS fanatic, but a claim that resulted from that encounter really required proof, just like my neighbor across the alley.</p> 
<p>And when I truly don't recall the details of an incident I continue to confront what's been alluded to where it may have lived, not by challenging those making a claims about the current circumstance. I was challenged by populations recovering from the commission of heinous crime to become familiar with the true nature of my problem, which they believed to be precisely that - to have forgotten or blacked out what happened, so I recreated one incident in order to find out. It’s difficult enough to have to live with reports on the subject, and we’re all learning how to use the internet to do so creatively, but I think its been useful to have at least one example of a more direct approach.</p>
<p>The perspective I gained by studying the problem in another State couldn’t be used at home because I couldn't accomplish anything with it here. When I spoke of the things that happened to me what resulted was rarely clear, or fully understood. Today, I realize that professional intervention was advocated for by denying any other option, and most of us in our industry chose to use our own tools, or anonymous communities to accomplish the goals of recovery, so laying blame wasn't really possible. From my point of view, approaching an offender could only be accomplished with a camera and blame was to be avoided.</p>
<p>I was already under attack for trying to determine the magnitude of the threat we faced by the new man of the house with tickles and choking. It was a hazardous occupation, and one best handled out of State. Very few believed what had happened to us because we reported them to the healthcare system and they were implicated. Because my own investigation included the discovery of things like circumcision, I may have been prevented from the opportunity to prosecute the case in order to protect their own practice, and years of rigorous work was required of me just to become clear about what I know to be true.</p>
